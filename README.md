An embroy of a Mud "thick" client for Android

This is my attempt at making a MUD, what's now on github is a thick client with minimal functionality, or, small world. It can be extended
but I have not written a world text format or something like that. It also does not come with a server yet. That being the authority in
the system and thru which you will be able to example chat with other players or adopt animals. The system as it is includes the
possibility to grow a flower. I think it might be hard to figure out how though and that's another problem; not much help is in the system
right now. Any help is appreciated.
